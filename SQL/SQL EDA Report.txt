Netflix Data Exploration
Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis of Netflix content using SQL. To analyze a dataset from Kaggle to explore various aspects of Netflix's content landscape. This analysis aims to examine the distribution of content by genre, country, release year, content type (movie or TV show), and rating. Additionally, we seek to uncover patterns related to directors, the duration of movies and TV shows, and how content trends have evolved. By querying and analyzing this dataset, we aim to gain deeper insights into Netflix's content offerings and the shifts in content patterns over the years.
